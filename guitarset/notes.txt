Create folders and csv files that mirror the MiniLibriSpeech dataset structure.

Tasks:
  - Create train, validation and test splits
  - Create preliminary csv files
  - Convert the six channel hex tracks into single tracks and move them to separate folders labelled from s1     to s6
  - Create finalised csv files using the MiniLibriSpeech metadata headers
  - Convert the sample rate to 16000 (or should I do this on the fly?)
